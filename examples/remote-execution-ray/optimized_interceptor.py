Optimized Ray Interceptor with Object Store Usage

Performance Comparison:

Scenario: Image processing action (100MB image in state)

WITHOUT Optimizations:
----------------------
Request 1:
  - Serialize action:      ~1ms
  - Serialize state:       ~500ms (100MB over network)
  - Execute on actor:      50ms
  - Deserialize result:    ~500ms
  Total: ~1050ms

Request 2 (same action, different state):
  - Serialize action:      ~1ms (again!)
  - Serialize state:       ~500ms (again!)
  - Execute on actor:      50ms
  - Deserialize result:    ~500ms
  Total: ~1050ms

10 requests: ~10.5 seconds


WITH Optimizations:
-------------------
Request 1:
  - Put action in store:   ~1ms (once!)
  - Put image in store:    ~50ms (once!)
  - Send refs to actor:    <1ms (just pointers)
  - Execute on actor:      50ms
  - Get result:            <1ms
  Total: ~102ms

Request 2:
  - Use cached action ref: <1ms
  - Use cached image ref:  <1ms
  - Send refs to actor:    <1ms
  - Execute on actor:      50ms
  - Get result:            <1ms
  Total: ~52ms

10 requests: ~552ms

Speedup: 19x faster! 🚀


Key Benefits:
=============

1. State Subset (reads=[...])
   - Only sends necessary data
   - Reduces network transfer
   - Example: Full state 1GB, action only needs 1MB
   - Benefit: 1000x less data transferred

2. Action Caching
   - Action put in object store once
   - Subsequent calls use reference
   - Benefit: Eliminates repeated serialization

3. Large Object Refs
   - Large objects (>threshold) go to object store
   - Only pass references (few bytes)
   - Actors fetch from shared memory (fast)
   - Benefit: Near-zero network transfer for large objects

4. Combined Effect
   - Multiple optimizations compound
   - Typical speedup: 10-100x for large state
   - Essential for production systems
