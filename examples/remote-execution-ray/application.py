"""
Example demonstrating how to use Burr's action execution interceptors to run
actions remotely on Ray workers.

This example shows:
1. How to create a RayActionInterceptor to execute actions on Ray
2. How worker hooks run on the remote Ray worker
3. How to mix local and remote execution based on action tags
