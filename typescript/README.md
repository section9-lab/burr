# Apache Burr (TypeScript)

TypeScript implementation of Apache Burr - a framework for building applications that make decisions (chatbots, agents, simulations, etc.) from simple building blocks.

## Status

🚧 **Work in Progress** - This is an active port of the Python implementation. APIs may change.

## Structure

- `packages/burr-core/` - Core library (state machine, actions, application)
- `examples/` - TypeScript examples
- `tests/` - Integration tests

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build all packages
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Documentation

See the main [Burr documentation](https://burr.apache.org/) for concepts and guides. TypeScript-specific documentation coming soon.

## Compatibility

This implementation aims to match the Python version's core functionality with TypeScript idioms and best practices.

## Feature Parity
