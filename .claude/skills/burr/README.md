# Apache Burr Claude Skill

A comprehensive Claude Code skill for building stateful applications with Apache Burr.

## What is this?

This is a Claude Code skill that teaches Claude how to help you build applications using Apache Burr. When active, Claude becomes an expert in Burr's APIs, best practices, and common patterns.

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from GitHub (Easiest)

```bash
# Install to personal skills directory
claude skill install https://github.com/apache/burr/.claude/skills/burr

# Or install to your current project
claude skill install https://github.com/apache/burr/.claude/skills/burr --project
```

### Option 2: Manual Install - Project-level (For teams)

Copy this skill to your project's `.claude/skills/` directory:

```bash
# From your project root
cp -r /path/to/burr/.claude/skills/burr .claude/skills/

# Or clone and copy from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/apache/burr
cp -r burr/.claude/skills/burr .claude/skills/
```

### Option 3: Manual Install - Personal scope (For individual use)

Copy to your personal Claude skills directory:

```bash
# Copy to personal skills directory
cp -r /path/to/burr/.claude/skills/burr ~/.claude/skills/

# Or clone and copy from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/apache/burr
cp -r burr/.claude/skills/burr ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Verify Installation

The skill should now appear in Claude Code's skill menu:

```bash
/burr --help
```

Or just ask Claude naturally:
```
"Help me build a Burr application for a chatbot"
```

## What Can It Do?

This skill helps you:

- **Build new Burr applications** - Get help scaffolding state machines
- **Write actions** - Create properly structured action functions
- **Define transitions** - Set up conditional and default transitions
- **Add observability** - Configure tracking and the Burr UI
- **Debug issues** - Troubleshoot common problems
- **Follow best practices** - Learn recommended patterns
- **Review code** - Get feedback on your Burr applications

## Usage Examples

### Manual Invocation

Explicitly invoke the skill with the `/burr` command:

```
/burr How do I create a streaming action?

/burr Review this action for best practices

/burr Help me add state persistence to my app
```

### Automatic Invocation

Claude will automatically load the skill when it detects you're working with Burr:

```
"I'm building a chatbot with Burr and need help with the state machine"

"Why isn't my action updating the state?"

"Show me an example of parallel execution in Burr"
```

## What's Included

The skill includes:

- **SKILL.md** - Main skill instructions for Claude
- **api-reference.md** - Complete API documentation
- **examples.md** - Working code examples for common patterns
- **patterns.md** - Best practices and design patterns
- **troubleshooting.md** - Solutions to common issues

Claude will reference these files to provide accurate, helpful guidance.

## Features

### Code Generation

```
"Create a Burr application that processes user queries with RAG"
```

Claude will generate a complete application with actions, transitions, and tracking.

### Code Review

```
"Review my Burr application for best practices"
```

Claude will check for:
- Correct `reads` and `writes` declarations
- Proper state immutability
- Complete transition coverage
- Tracking configuration
- Error handling

### Debugging Help

```
"My state machine is looping infinitely, what's wrong?"
```

Claude will:
- Analyze your transitions
- Suggest using `.visualize()` to see the graph
- Recommend fixes based on common issues

### Learning & Examples

```
"Show me how to implement retries in Burr"
```

Claude will provide working examples from the examples.md reference.

## Skill Configuration

### Allowed Tools

The skill permits Claude to use:
- `Read` - Read your code files
- `Grep` - Search for patterns
- `Glob` - Find files
- `Bash` - Run Python, burr CLI, and pip commands

### Automatic Activation

The skill activates when you:
- Mention "Burr" or "Apache Burr"
- Show code with `from burr.core import`
- Ask about state machines or actions
- Need help with stateful applications

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific** - "Help me add retry logic to my fetch action" is better than "help with errors"

2. **Show your code** - Claude works best when it can see what you're working with

3. **Ask for examples** - "Show me an example of..." gets working code

4. **Reference the docs** - Ask Claude to check the API reference or patterns guide

5. **Use visualization** - Ask Claude to suggest using `app.visualize()` when debugging

## Examples of What to Ask

### Getting Started
- "Help me create my first Burr application"
- "What's the basic structure of a Burr action?"
- "Show me a simple chatbot example"

### Building Features
- "How do I add streaming to my LLM action?"
- "Show me how to implement parallel execution"
- "Help me add state persistence with SQLite"

### Debugging
- "Why isn't my transition working?"
- "My action isn't updating state, what's wrong?"
- "How do I debug an infinite loop?"

### Best Practices
- "Review this code for Burr best practices"
- "Is this the right way to structure my state machine?"
- "How should I handle errors in actions?"
